# HAT_Train_Ticketing_System
A group project for a university course where we were assigned to develop a train ticketing system using java. The train ticketing system is used for booking trains from Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru. The line has one train each day for only five passengers. The system is used for booking tickets on the dates available. It is also used for viewing passenger tickets and can be used to update their information or delete their ticket. It also informs the user whether they are in the confirmed list for the train or in the waiting list. The system updates automatically if someone deletes their ticket from the confirmed list.
